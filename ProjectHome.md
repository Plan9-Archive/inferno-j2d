At one time in the development of Inferno, someone thought it would be helpful to be able to run Java® .class files on Inferno's virtual machine (Dis). The various methods were documented in a paper "Using Inferno to Execute Java on Small Devices" by Yurkoski, Rau, and Ellis.

This is the subset of the software that can now be made available by Vita Nuova Holdings Limited under the GPLv2. The supporting Sun Java code (ca. 1997) was marked as proprietary, and has been replaced by empty files. Many of those can probably be filled by the contents of similar files from Java releases as open source. That is part of the scope of this project.

Java is a trademark of Oracle®.
