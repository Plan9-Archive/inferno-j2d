This project is intended to run Java 7 apps natively in inferno,
by converting class files to dis and linking them at runtime.

Currently working features:
	- none, see problem list below
	- although jvm runtime loader and linker is supposed to
	work with java 1.4 classes (there was no chance to get
	those sources, as java released only 1.5 ones and later)
	sources are needed to provide native part of the JCL

TODO:
	- reworkd j2d to support modern exception handling in dis
	- implement support for new bytecode instructions:
		- ldc, ldc2, ldcw_2, ldc2_w: those will accept
		more argument types, see http://docs.oracle.com/
		javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-4.html#jvms-4.10.1.9.ldc
		since class file version 49.0
		- invokedynamic, completely new since 49.0
	- prepare the pkg dir that would contain all the JCL classes
	from the OpenJDK (as they come with GPL license), compiled and
	translated into dis
	- more to come later...
